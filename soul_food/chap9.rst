Southern Fried Catfish
========================================================


--Ingredients-------------------------------------------
½ cup buttermilk
½ cup water
salt and pepper, to taste
1 pound catfish fillets, cut in strips
1 ½ cups fine cornmeal
½ cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay™
1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying

--Instructions------------------------------------------

1.) In a small bowl, mix buttermilk, water, salt, and pepper. Pour mixture into
a flat pan large enough to hold the fillets. Spread fish in one layer over bottom
of pan, turning to coat each side, and set aside to marinate.

2.) In a 2 gallon resealable plastic bag, combine the cornmeal, flour, and
seafood seasoning. Add fish to mixture, a few fillets at a time, and tumble
gently to coat evenly.

3.) Heat oil in deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).

4.) Deep fry fillets until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Avoid overcrowding so
fillets have room to brown properly. Fish should be slightly crisp outside, and
moist and flaky inside. Drain on paper towels.
