========================================================


--Ingredients-------------------------------------------
8 medium (2-1/2" dia) (approx 4 per lb)s fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and sliced into thin wedges
¼ cup white sugar
¼ cup brown sugar
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup white sugar
¼ cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
¼ cup boiling water

Mix together
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

--Instructions------------------------------------------
Step 1
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Step 2
In a large bowl, combine peaches, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon,
nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a 2 quart baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.

Step 3
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder,
and salt. Blend in butter with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse
meal. Stir in water until just combined.

Step 4
Remove peaches from oven, and drop spoonfuls of topping over them. Sprinkle entire cobbler with the
sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake until topping is golden, about 30 minutes.
