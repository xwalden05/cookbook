Grilled Roast
========================================================


--Ingredients-------------------------------------------
6 garlic cloves, minced
2 tbsp minced fresh rosemary
4 tsp kosher salt
1 tbsp pepper
3 lbs top sirloin roast, trimmed of all visible fat
1 (13 x 9 inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan

--Instructions------------------------------------------

1.) Combine the garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper in a bowl.
2.) Pat the roast dry with paper towels and sprinkle evenly with salt mixture.
3.) Wrap the roast with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours.
4.) Punch fifteen 1/4-inch holes in the center of the roasting pan, which should be about the size of the roast, and set aside.
5.) Clean and oil the cooking grate.
6.) Place the roast on the hotter part of the grill and cook (covered if using gas) until well browned on all sides, about 10
minutes, turning as needed.
7.) Place the roast in the pan over the holes and transfer the pan to the cooler part of the grill.
Cover (positioning the lid vents over the meat if using charcoal) and cook until the roast registers 125 degrees F on an
instant-read thermometer (for medium-rare), 40 to 60 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through.
8.) Transfer the roast to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes.
Transfer the roast to a carving board and cut across the grain into thin slices.
