Family Favorite

--Ingredients-------------------------------------------
1 pound ziti (can sub penne) pasta
Extra virgin olive oil
1 pound bulk Italian sausage or ground beef or pork
1 large onion, chopped
3-4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary (or basil), minced
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 large jar of marinara sauce (about 32 ounces) or make your own tomato sauce
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 pound of mozzarella cheese, grated or shredded
1 heaping cup of ricotta cheese
1 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese
--Instructions------------------------------------------

1.) Cook the pasta
2.) Brown the meat:
3.) Make the sauce: When the meat is mostly browned, add the onions and stir well
to combine. Sauté everything until the onions are translucent and beginning to
brown, about 4-5 minutes.
Add the garlic, rosemary or basil, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes and
stir to combine. Cook 1 minute, then add the tomato sauce and stir well. Bring
to a simmer. Add salt and pepper, and adjust seasonings to your taste.
4.) Preheat the oven to 350°F.
5.) Layer in casserole dish: Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a
9x13-inch casserole pan, then dot the surface with half the ricotta cheese. Ladle
a spoonful of sauce into the pasta, stir it well and then add the pasta into the
casserole.
Pour the rest of the sauce over the pasta, dot the remaining ricotta cheese over
the pasta, and sprinkle on top both the mozzarella and the Parmesan cheese.
At this point you can cover and refrigerate or freeze to make ahead.
6.) Bake: Bake in oven at 350°F until the top is lightly browned and the cheese
melted, about 20 to 25 minutes.
